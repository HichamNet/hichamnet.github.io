Hello, I’m Hicham a cybersecurity master’s student with a strong interest in web, system security, network defense, and cloud technologies.

I created this site to document my learning journey, share hands-on labs, and connect with others who are passionate about IT and cybersecurity, I enjoy turning complex concepts into real projects.

My goal is simple: keep growing, keep building, and help secure the systems we all rely on.
